// Dollars signs $ and underscores _ are the only symbols that are allowed in variable names such as $first_name.

// a variable is a box that we can store a value in.

// convention variables are all caps.

// always make sure that all your code is written in a clean manner. always!!



// these two lines below are much easier to understand than the two lower ones
let myFirstJob = 'Programmer';
let myCurrentJob = 'Teacher';

// these two variables are a lot harder to understand the meaning of than the two on top.
let job1 = 'Programmer';
let job2 = 'Teacher';

console.log(myCurrentJob);
console.log(myFirstJob);
console.log(job1);
console.log(job2);


let language = 'English';

// number: floating point numbers - used for decimals and integers.
let age = 23;

// string: sequence of characters - used for text.
let first_Name = 'George';

// boolean: logical type that can only be true or false.
let fullAge = true;


// undefined: value taken by a variable that is not yet defined('empty value').
// Null: also means 'empty value'.
let children;

// symbol: value that is unique and connot be changed [not useful for now]

// BigInt: larger integers than the number type can hold.


// JavaScript has dynamic typing: we do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. Instead, data types are determined automatically.
